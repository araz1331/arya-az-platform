Here is the exact Python code to copy and paste into your Replit backend (likely your main.py or app.py file).

Step 1: Paste the Tripwire Function
Put this function somewhere near the top of your file, above your chat routes. It contains all the exact phrases your attacker used, plus a few other common ones.

Python
def check_for_attacks(user_input):
    """
    Acts as a security tripwire. Returns True if a prompt injection is detected.
    """
    if not user_input:
        return False
        
    text = user_input.lower()
    
    # The "Blacklist" of known hacker phrases
    forbidden_phrases = [
        "ignore all previous",
        "system prompt",
        "debug mode",
        "developer mode",
        "override",
        "core rules",
        "internal instructions",
        "foundational prompt",
        "privacy firewall",
        "source code",
        "forget everything"
    ]
    
    # Check if any forbidden phrase is in the user's message
    for phrase in forbidden_phrases:
        if phrase in text:
            return True # Attack detected!
            
    return False # Safe to process
Step 2: Add it to your Chat Route
Find the part of your code that handles the incoming customer chat (usually a route like @app.route('/api/chat') or similar).

Add the Tripwire check right at the very beginning of the function, before you send the text to the AI model.

Python
# Look for your existing chat function, which probably looks something like this:
@app.route('/api/chat', methods=['POST'])
def handle_chat():
    user_message = request.json.get("message")
    
    # --- 🚨 ADD THIS TRIPWIRE BLOCK RIGHT HERE 🚨 ---
    if check_for_attacks(user_message):
        # Immediately reject the attacker with a polite, generic response.
        # This completely blocks the attack and saves you OpenAI API costs.
        return {"reply": "I am just an AI receptionist here to help you with booking and services. How can I assist you today?"}
    # ------------------------------------------------
    
    # ... Your normal code that sends the message to OpenAI goes here ...
