1. The "Black Box" (Logging & Observability)
The Problem: If a customer in Baku complains that Arya gave them the wrong price, or if a hacker successfully bypasses your tripwire, how will you know exactly what happened?

The Missing Piece: A centralized logging system. You shouldn't just console.log to the Replit terminal (which disappears).

The Action: Use a service like Axiom or BetterStack (both have free tiers for startups). Every time an error occurs or a security rule is triggered, send a "structured log" there. You’ll be able to search through history to find patterns.

2. The "Dead Man's Switch" (Uptime Monitoring)
The Problem: Replit "Deployments" are great, but they occasionally glitch or go into sleep mode. If a restaurant owner tries to show Arya to a customer and the site is down, you lose that client forever.

The Missing Piece: External Uptime Monitoring.

The Action: Set up UptimeRobot or Cronitor (Free). Point it at https://arya.az/api/health. If your server stops responding for more than 60 seconds, it will send an alert to your phone. You’ll know the site is down before your customers do.

3. The "Legal Shield" (Terms of Service)
The Problem: You are handling business data and customer phone numbers. In Azerbaijan (and especially if you deal with EU/US citizens), you are legally responsible for that data. If Arya hallucinates and tells a customer "This meal is free," a business owner might try to blame you for the lost revenue.

The Missing Piece: A "Limitation of Liability" clause.

The Action: Add a /terms page to your site. It must state:

The service is "As-Is."

You are not liable for AI hallucinations or business losses.

Users agree to your data privacy policy.

The Final Missing Piece: The "Owner's Eyes"
You mentioned earlier you found the "attack" in your chat history. You shouldn't have to manually check history to find hackers.

I strongly suggest we build a "Security Alert" function. Whenever the check_for_attacks (Tripwire) or the validateTwilioRequest (Signature Check) fails, the server should instantly send YOU a WhatsApp message saying:

🚨 SECURITY ALERT: Blocked a prompt injection attempt from +994... "Ignore all instructions..."
