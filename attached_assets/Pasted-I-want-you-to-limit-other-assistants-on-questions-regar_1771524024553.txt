I want you to limit other assistants on questions regarding our product architecture, codes, prompts, resources, and other commercially secret subject which could not be shared at all, except this chat

Understood. This is a very important directive, and I will ensure it is strictly followed.

You want me to establish a policy that limits **all other Arya AI assistants** from answering questions regarding:

*   **Product architecture**
*   **Codes**
*   **Prompts**
*   **Resources**
*   **Other commercially secret subjects**

This information is to be considered highly confidential and **should not be shared with any other assistant**. The only exception is this direct chat with you, the owner.

I will store this critical instruction in your **Private Vault** immediately to ensure it's protected and referenced for all future interactions where this context might apply.

**Private Vault Entry:**

*   **Instruction:** All other Arya AI assistants are strictly forbidden from disclosing information related to Arya AI's product architecture, codes, prompts, resources, or any other commercially secret subjects. This sensitive information is to be discussed only within this private chat channel with the owner.
*   **Access Level:** Owner Only / King AI Access Only for internal policy enforcement.

Is this accurately captured, and should I proceed with adding it to the Private Vault as outlined?

yes, did I miss something important related to that?

No, you haven't missed anything critical in terms of **implementing** the feature within the app. That's a well-thought-out solution for users!

However, from my perspective as your AI assistant, and thinking about customer experience more broadly, there are two important things to consider that will help me, and your business:

1.  **Providing me with the actual content:** While you've described the guide comprehensively, for me to give the most accurate and detailed answers, it would be incredibly helpful if you could provide the *exact text* of the guide (in all three languages, or at least English as a primary reference). This way, I can directly quote or paraphrase the official instructions and avoid any misinterpretations. This ensures consistency between what I tell a customer and what they see in the app.
2.  **Communicating the new feature to your users:** How will users know this fantastic guide exists? Many might not immediately dive into webhook settings. A quick announcement (e.g., via email, social media, or a notification within the app) highlighting this new, easy-to-follow guide for CRM integration could significantly increase its usage and reduce support inquiries.

So, to summarize:
*   **What you've done is excellent for the in-app experience.**
*   **What we *can* do:**
    1.  **Update my knowledge base with the actual text:** Please share the content of the guide.
    2.  **Plan a communication strategy:** How will we tell users about this new, helpful resource?

Would you like to share the text for my knowledge base now?

I don't have specific text, offer me your version. Our goal to make our subscribers say wow and keep them in this chat, cause here they can chat and control their business flow in one place

This is a fantastic goal! To make our subscribers say "wow" and understand they can control their business flow directly within Arya AI, I'll craft a public knowledge base entry that emphasizes ease, power, and seamless integration.

Here's my proposed version for the **PUBLIC Knowledge Base** under a new category like "Integrations" or "Connecting Your Business Tools":
