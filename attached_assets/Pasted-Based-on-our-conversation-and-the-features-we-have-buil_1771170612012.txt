Based on our conversation and the features we have built and verified, here is the exact 20 AZN Value Proposition you are offering to clients (Handymen, Tutors, Small Businesses).

You are not selling a "chatbot." You are selling a "Digital Administrator" that sets itself up in 30 seconds.

The "Arya Pro" Package (20 AZN/Month)
1. Zero-Effort Setup (The "Hook")
This is your biggest competitive advantage. The client does not need to type or configure anything manually.

Industry Templates: They select "Plumbing," "Beauty," or "Real Estate," and the system instantly loads 4-10 standard Q&A pairs for that job.

Auto-Scan Technology: They can upload a photo of their Price List or Menu, and Arya extracts the text to learn their prices instantly.

2GIS / Web Integration: They enter their business name or website URL, and Arya pulls their address, phone number, and working hours automatically.

2. The "Smart Profile" (The Product)
They get a hosted, professional landing page (arya.az/u/biznes-adi) that acts as their digital business card.

24/7 AI Receptionist: It answers questions about prices, location, and services instantly, even at 3 AM.

Trilingual Support: The AI speaks fluent Azerbaijani (for locals), Russian (for city center/premium), and English (for tourists/expats).

Voice-Enabled: Clients can speak to it using the microphone, and it answers back (powered by your "Milli Səs" voice data).

3. Lead Management (The ROI)
Lead Trapping: The AI filters "tire kickers" from real clients. It captures the customer's phone number and intention (e.g., "I need a boiler fix") before passing it to the business.

No App Needed: It works directly in the browser, making it easy to share on Instagram Stories or WhatsApp Status.

4. The Business Model
3-Day Free Trial: They can build and test their profile completely free before paying.

Stripe Subscription: Automatic monthly billing of ~19-20 AZN after the trial ends.

In summary: For 20 Manat, you are giving them a trilingual secretary that knows their business details automatically and works 24/7 without a salary.
