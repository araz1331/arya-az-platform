3. The "Universal Use Cases" (Adapted from your Old Site)

Instruction: Recreate the "Samir Usta / Aysel / Kebab House" 3-Card Layout but translate them to show global versatility.

Card 1 (The Handyman):

Icon: 🔧

Name: "Samir - HVAC Expert" (or "Carlos" for ES, "Pierre" for FR).

Chat Bubble: "Hi! Boiler repair starts at $20. Book now?"

Card 2 (The Tutor):

Icon: 🎓

Name: "Sarah - English Tutor."

Chat Bubble: "I have slots open for Tuesday. Want to join?"

Card 3 (The Restaurant):

Icon: 🍴

Name: "Baku Kebab House."

Chat Bubble: "Yes, we deliver in 30 minutes!"

Interaction: Add a "Live Demo" button under each card that opens a mini-chat simulation in that language.

4. The "Language Engine" Section (New)

Headline: "Fluent in 30 Languages."

Visual: A map of the world. Show the chat bubble translating instantly from "Hello" → "Hola" → "Salam" → "Bonjour".

Copy: "Your customers speak different languages. Arya speaks them all automatically."

5. How It Works (Universal Symbols)

Use icons instead of heavy text so it translates easily.

Step 1: 📸 Scan Menu (Camera Icon).

Step 3: 🔗 Share Link (Link/Globe Icon).

6. Pricing (Currency Aware)

Switch: Monthly / Yearly.
